### `Description`

Welcome to Project 07 of the Udacity Front-End Developer Nanodegree program. In this final project, the primary goal for students is to create a single-page application using React featuring a map of their neighborhood or a neighborhood they would like to visit. Unlike previous projects, this project does not include the added benefit of 'starter' code to give students a jump-start on development. Students will be challenged to draw upon all of their technical skills + knowledge in order to successfully complete this project, as they essentially will be developing the project from scratch. Key functionality such as: Google Maps + Third-Party API usage, Map Markers, List of Locations, and Search Filtering. Once again, this project (like Project 06) emphasizes using the React JavaScript library to buildout the application, and leverages the Google Maps JavaScript API for map data and the FourSquare API for venue data.

### `Installation`

To run the project:
* Download + install Node.js.
* Clone (or download) the .zip project files folder to your local desktop.
* Open terminal app and navigate to project folder.
* Type: `npm install` to install the required project dependencies.
* Type: `npm start` to start the development server, which will then open a browser window running the app located at `http://localhost:3000/` upon successful startup.
